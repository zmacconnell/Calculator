# Overview

This program is an introduction for myself in the Rust language.

It is a simple calculator that takes a string and seperates it apart,
then takes tehh 1st and 3rd parts and turns them into integers. The
2nd part is then checked against basic mathematical functions to
calculate the result of the problem.

## Development Environment

Development of this Rust program was done in VS Code, with the rust-analyzer
extension to run the program.

With Rust installed, use the command `cargo run` go start the calculator.
